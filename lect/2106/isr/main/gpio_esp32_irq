This test code shows how to configure a gpio and how to use gpio interrupts.

GPIO18: output
GPIO19: output
GPIO4: input, pulled up, interrupts from the rising and falling edges
GPIO5: input, pulled up, interrupt from the rising edge.

Test:
Connect GPIO18 to GPIO4
Connect GPIO19 to GPIO5
Generate pulses on GPIO18 / GPIO19, which trigger interrupts on GPIO4 / GPIO5
